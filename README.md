# SDLBase
SDL2 experiments
By Paul Hindt, 4/22/2015

This is my first attempt at learning how a 2D game engine is constructed.
The solution file and code was created in Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition. With some tweaking it will compile in VS2012.
I have not yet tried to compile with GNU C++ but it does build in XCode with Clang.

Current Functionality:
- Movable player entity
- Player can "shoot" a projectile aimed with the mouse
- Scrolling tilemap background
- Rudimentary sprite sheet animations and texture loading

Goals:
- Read/write tile map data to/from disk.
- Expand vector math library
- Sound effects and music playback
